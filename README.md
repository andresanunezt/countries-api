# Countries-Api
Welcome to the Countries API CLI.
This CLI allows the user to select a country from a list and view more information on it, such as population, capital and language spoken.

All information is pulled from the REST countries api.
(http://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all)


# Motivation 
As a child, I would spend hours searching the web and different encyclopedias trying to learn as much as I could about different countries. With this CLI, you can  learn about different cuntries' aspects in seconds.

# Installation
Make sure you have the following Gems installed:

'rest-client'

'json'

'colorize'

With Ruby already installed on your computer and with the appropaite gems, it is as simple as forking and cloning this repository to your local enviornment.
Navigate to the countries-api folder in your terminal and enter "bin/run_world".
